            <h2>Harees</h2>
            <p>
                Harees, jareesh (Arabic: هريس), boko boko, or harisa (Armenian: հարիսա, romanized: harisa) is a dish of
                boiled, cracked,
                or coarsely-ground cracked wheat or bulgur, mixed with meat and seasoned.[1] Its consistency varies
                between a porridge
                and a gruel. Harees is a popular dish known throughout Armenia where it is served on Easter day, and the
                Arab world,
                where it is commonly eaten in Arab states of the Persian Gulf in the month of Ramadan, and in Iraq,
                Lebanon and Bahrain
                during Ashura by Shia Muslims.

            <h2>Quzi</h2>
            <p>
                Quzi (Arabic: قوزي), also spelled as qoozi or ghoozi, is a popular rice-based dish and is considered one
                of Iraq's
                national dishes. It is served with very slowly cooked lamb, roasted nuts, and raisins served over
                rice.[1] The dish was
                introduced into Turkey by Syrian immigrants.[citation needed] The dish can also be found in some Arab
                states of the
                Persian Gulf.
